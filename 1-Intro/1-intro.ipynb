      "Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, my fellow Americans:\n",
      "Tonight marks the eighth year that I’ve come here to report on the State of the Union. And for this final one, I’m going to try to make it shorter. I know some of you are antsy to get back to Iowa. I've been there. I'll be shaking hands afterwards if you want some tips.\n",
      "Now I understand that because it’s an election season, expectations for what we’ll achieve this year are low. But Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the constructive approach that you and the other leaders took at the end of last year to pass a budget and make tax cuts permanent for working families. So I hope we can work together this year on some bipartisan priorities like criminal justice reform, and helping people who are battling prescription drug abuse and heroin abuse. So who knows: we might surprise the cynics again.\n",
      "But tonight, I want to go easy on the traditional list of proposals for the year ahead. Don’t worry: I’ve got plenty, from helping students learn to write computer code to personalizing medical treatments for patients. And I will keep pushing for progress on the work that still needs to be done. Fixing a broken immigration system. Protecting our kids from gun violence. Equal pay for equal work, paid leave, raising the minimum wage. All these things still matter to hardworking families; they are still the right thing to do; and I won't let up until they get done.\n",
      "But for my final address to this chamber, I don’t want to talk just about next year. I want to focus on the next five years, the next ten years, and beyond.\n"

    "I make a request to wikisources for President Obama's last state of the union speech. From the beautiful soup object of the text returned from this request, I separate out the paragraphs designated by a 'p' tag. From each of these paragraphs, I make a few pandas dataframes. The first dataframe contains one paragraph in each row (no regex necessary, as the text was already clean). The second dataframe contains each of the sentences (the regex splits on positive lookbehinds and lookaheads using uppercase letters in the beginning and punctuation at the end). The third dataframe contains all the numbers in the text (the regex is able to capture commas in the numbers). The fourth dataframe shows a count of the number of times each word appeared in the text. I first regex out each word (apostrophes included, uppercase converted to lower case) and create a dictionary of each word and increment the count if the word is encountered again.</span>"
