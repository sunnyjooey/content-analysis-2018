They all involve systematic reading or observation of texts or artifacts which are assigned labels (sometimes called codes) to indicate the presence of interesting, meaningful patterns.[2][3] After labeling a large set of media, a researcher is able to statistically estimate the proportions of patterns in the texts, as well as correlations between patterns.\n",

Simple computational techniques can provide descriptive data such as word frequencies and document lengths. Machine learning classifiers can greatly increase the number of texts which can be labeled, but the scientific utility of doing so is a matter of debate.\n"

So I hope we can work together this year on some bipartisan priorities like criminal justice reform, and helping people who are battling prescription drug abuse and heroin abuse. So who knows: we might surprise the cynics again.\n",
      "But tonight, I want to go easy on the traditional list of proposals for the year ahead. Don’t worry: I’ve got plenty, from helping students learn to write computer code to personalizing medical treatments for patients. And I will keep pushing for progress on the work that still needs to be done. Fixing a broken immigration system. Protecting our kids from gun violence. Equal pay for equal work, paid leave, raising the minimum wage. All these things still matter to hardworking families; they are still the right thing to do; and I won't let up until they get done.\n",
      "But for my final address to this chamber, I don’t want to talk just about next year. I want to focus on the next five years, the next ten years, and beyond.\n"
