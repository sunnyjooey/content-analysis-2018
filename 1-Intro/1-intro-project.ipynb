From the beautiful soup object of the text returned from this request, I separate out the paragraphs designated by a 'p' tag. From each of these paragraphs, I make a few pandas dataframes. The first dataframe contains one paragraph in each row (no regex necessary, as the text was already clean). The second dataframe contains each of the sentences (the regex splits on positive lookbehinds and lookaheads using uppercase letters in the beginning and punctuation at the end). The third dataframe contains all the numbers in the text (the regex is able to capture commas in the numbers). The fourth dataframe shows a count of the number of times each word appeared in the text. I first regex out each word (apostrophes included, uppercase converted to lower case) and create a dictionary of each word and increment the count if the word is encountered again.</span>"

    "    I make a request for the pdf of the speech of Nelson Mandela's inaugural address. Then I extract the bytes and read in the text of the pdf using the code provided. The pdf has a lot of explanatory text before and after the speech, so I select only the actual speech from the text through indexing. I clean up the text with a few regex substitutions, then split the speech into a the title and the text and create a dictionary. I create a dataframe showing the title and text of the speech from the dictionary. I can add to this pandas dataframe by creating more such SpeechDicts and appending them to the speeches list. </span>"
